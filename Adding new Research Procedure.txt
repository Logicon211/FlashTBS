Give it a name "insertRaceNameHere" + research name

Create graphic

Give graphics in 4 separate frames:
	-researchSelected
	-researchFinished
	-researchNotAvailable

create a class for it as a subclass of ResearchItem

Define this in the class:
	-xCord (X position on research map)
	-yCord (Y position on research map)
	-timeCost (Time cost of the research)
	-timeLeft = timeCost
	-researchName (name of the research)
	-description (description of the research)
	-prereqList.push ("add prerequisite research here")
		-do this ^^ for every prerequisite of the research

override the function onComplete(). 
	-Make it go through the players unit or building list if it upgrades a unit, otherwise, you probably wont put the code in here. This is just for units and buildings already in play
	- Add this to the end:
		selected = false; //it is finished so it is no longer selected
		player.activeResearch = null; //This is ocmpleted so the ucrrent actie research is nothing now.

Go to the Player Race that owns this research and in its constructor add:
	researchList[0] = new 'ResearchClassHere'();
	researchList[0].initialize(this);

if the research effects a unit or a buildings stats, make it check for THIS current research item in this unit/building's constructor to see if its complete, if so apply the desired upgrade effects.

Otherwise, if its an upgrade that unlocks a unit, or unlocks a new menu item or something, have that item/building/whatever check to see if this upgrade has been complete, and if so, have the desired 'THING' available.
