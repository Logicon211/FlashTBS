FlashTBS
========

A (quite big) project I started a while ago in flash. Wanted to make a large turn based strategy game. Got the main engine done, but I had stopped working on it due to school.


- I have a test setup to run through some of the engine code.
- There are 2 identical planets, clicking on them allow you to enter the planets map
- There are 2 players (Red and Blue)
- Movement, Attacks, and Fog of war work almost identical to Advance Wars
- Can build new units from a factory
- Cities give more credits per turn
- I set up the very basics of a tech tree as well. the few technologies there actually change the units in game
- Research factories speed up research each turn
- 


- Feel free to fork and modify, I'd like to see this work go somewhere, I might come back to it in the future.
